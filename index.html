  <div class="help3" class="minor-section">
    • More opportunities for social connection: Replace canceled
    events, services, and classes with virtual ones <br>
    • Engage in long-term planning: Colleges need to be prepared to
    help students heal and recover when they return and put in place
    improved practices and protocols to more easily pivot to remote
    learning in case of another similar crisis.
